➔ Create a simple .NET application using Blazor and TDD
➔ The application be anything you want
examples: simple weather application, hotel booking application, online 
shopping cart etc
➔ At least one component should be written using Test Driven 
Development:
▪ Create a test class and write unit tests for all the component 
you just create. The tests should cover the functionalities.
▪ Implement the component using TDD. This means that you 
should write a test, run it to see that it fails, then write the 
minimum amount of code needed to make the test pass. 
Repeat this process until the component is fully 
implemented.
➔ The entire project should be version controlled using Git and be 
uploaded to Github.
➔ Since it is a group work, it is also good to have an agile 
methodology during the development of this application.
➔ Submission instructions: 
▪ A report containing all the steps taken to create this 
application. It should also contain screenshots of the 
application and the steps.
▪ A link to the Github for the project
▪ A README.md file (inside your Github repository) with 
instructions on how to run the application
